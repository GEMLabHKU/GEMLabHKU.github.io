## ðŸ’Ž Why GEM Lab?

GEM Lab was established in 2024. The name *GEM* stands for **Get Everyone Moving** or **Guiding AI in Education: Methods and Applications**.

To be honest, I chose the name not only for its meaning, but also because I believe every member of this team is a true **GEM** ðŸ’Ž â€” talented, unique, and full of potential.

We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the intersection of **AI, education, psychology, and cognitive science**. We aim to design intelligent, human-centered learning systems and explore how educational technologies can empower diverse learners.

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Mission

GEM Lab is dedicated to:

- Advancing AI applications in **education and learning science**
- Understanding **human cognition and learning behaviors** using computational methods
- Promoting equity and inclusivity in **technology-enhanced learning environments**

We combine **machine learning**, **student modeling**, and **human-in-the-loop approaches** to develop next-generation intelligent tutoring systems and assessment tools.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Areas

Our research spans across multiple interdisciplinary themes:

- **Student Simulation and Performance Modeling**  
  Building cognitive models to simulate student behavior, mistakes, and learning trajectories.

- **Machine Unlearning and Fairness in AI for Education**  
  Investigating how educational AI can be made fairer, more transparent, and adaptive to change.

- **Curriculum Learning and Knowledge Tracing**  
  Using sequence models and knowledge distillation to enhance personalized learning.

- **AI-Augmented Instructional Design**  
  Developing LLM-based tools for automating lesson planning, feedback, and curriculum generation.

## ðŸŒŸ Representative Projects

- **AI Tutor Generator**  
  A Streamlit-based system that generates personalized teaching plans from research papers using LLMs.

- **Student Simulation Challenge**  
  A benchmark suite for evaluating the robustness of simulated learners in adaptive environments.

- **Knowledge Tracing via Distillation**  
  A lightweight yet effective framework for tracing and predicting student performance across domains.

- **Human-AI Co-teaching Framework**  
  Designing systems where AI augments human teachers rather than replacing them.
