Welcome to the GEM Lab (Group for Emotion and Mental health), directed by **Prof. Haolin Jiang**.  
We focus on understanding the neural and psychological mechanisms behind emotion, mental health, and social cognition, through a combination of computational modeling, behavioral experiments, and neuroimaging.

## ðŸ§­ Lab Mission

The GEM Lab is dedicated to advancing scientific understanding of emotion, cognition, and psychopathology.  
We aim to:

- Explore how emotions shape decision-making and learning  
- Develop computational models to capture individual differences in affective processing  
- Investigate mental disorders such as depression and anxiety through behavioral and brain-based measures

## ðŸ”¬ Research Areas

Our work spans the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Current topics include:

- **Computational Psychiatry**  
  Using reinforcement learning and Bayesian modeling to understand cognitive biases in depression and anxiety.

- **Affective Neuroscience**  
  Investigating the brain networks involved in emotion regulation, reward processing, and mood dynamics.

- **Social Decision-Making**  
  Studying how people make moral or prosocial choices under uncertainty and emotion.

- **AI + Mental Health**  
  Applying machine learning to mental health diagnostics and early detection.

## ðŸŒŸ Representative Projects

- **Emotion and Learning**  
  Modeling how emotional states modulate learning signals (e.g., prediction errors) in healthy and clinical populations.

- **Mood Drift in Dynamic Environments**  
  Understanding how mood fluctuates over time in response to task structure and feedback.

- **Depression Risk Profiling**  
  Developing computational markers for depression vulnerability using passive behavioral data.

- **Value-based Decision Making under Stress**  
  Exploring how acute stress alters value computations and risk preferences.
