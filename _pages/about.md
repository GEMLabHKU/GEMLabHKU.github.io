# Welcome to GEMLab @ HKU

The **Generative Education and Media Lab (GEMLab)**, led by **Prof. Haolin Lin**, is based in the Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong. Our mission is to explore the frontiers of artificial intelligence (AI) in education and media, with a particular focus on **generative models**, **student simulation**, and **intelligent curriculum design**.

---

## 🎯 Lab Mission

We aim to integrate cutting-edge AI technologies—such as large language models (LLMs), generative agents, and simulation frameworks—into educational and cognitive research. Our goal is to **build intelligent, interactive, and personalized educational experiences**.

---

## 🔬 Research Areas

- **Student Simulation**: Modeling learning behaviors using AI agents to emulate human learners.
- **Curriculum Generation**: Designing AI-powered tools for generating and evaluating educational curricula.
- **Knowledge Distillation & Tracing**: Tracking and enhancing student knowledge states using machine learning.
- **Machine Unlearning in Education**: Ensuring ethical data removal and adaptive feedback in educational systems.
- **AI + Learning Sciences**: Combining cognitive theories with computational models to promote effective learning.

---

## 🚀 Representative Projects

- **SimStu**: A simulated student framework for evaluating adaptive teaching strategies.
- **AutoCurriculum**: A generative system for designing and aligning teaching content.
- **LLM-for-Feedback**: Using GPT-based systems to provide instant, personalized student feedback.
- **BERTopic in Education**: Topic modeling and thematic analysis of large-scale educational discussions.
